A simple implementation of the very widely known game rock, paper, scissors, with a maximum of 5 points.

## Walkthrough

First, only a Javascript code and a HTML file were used. Using basic syntaxes like switch and for loops were enough to get the game up and working. The real challenge in this project was to put everything in an UI and make the game playable (and good looking, if I may). 

After implementing it in pure javascript code and getting it to work properly, it's time to create a UI. 

> The biggest challenge for me here was, after implementing the whole game, making it so the player couldn't spam click the buttons.
